#Description
The program allows the user to manage student records by performing various operations such as adding, displaying, updating, and deleting students. Each student’s information includes their ID, name, age, and grades. 
The program also calculates the average grade of each student for quick evaluation. Additionally, it provides functionality to save and load data from a CSV file so that information 
will not be lost when the program is closed.To demonstrate different data structures, the program uses tuples for storing student ID and name, lists for handling grades, 
and dictionaries for managing all student records. It also showcases operations like appending, removing, slicing lists, and dictionary key-value manipulation.

#Learning Experience
While making this program, I really struggled at first with handling files and figuring out how to organize the data properly. I also had a hard time working with different data structures like lists, tuples, 
and dictionaries because I wasn’t sure how to combine them in one program. I slowly learned how to use CSV files for saving and loading data, and how error handling can make the program run more smoothly. 
Even though it was difficult, these struggles helped me improve my coding skills and taught me how to solve problems step by step.
